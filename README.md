Let's Try a Proxy or LTP for short.

LTP is a proxy that can be deployed on a hosting service like Heroku or similar to make a proxy, basically a website in a website without redirecting the user to a different domain.

_This came with the OG repo which can be found_ [here](https://github.com/adventurousmallu/webxy)

You can access any website in the wall through this proxy website. This website serves as a forwarding function. Using heroku's application hosting service is completely free.
